# Patient Treatment-Recovery Data Analysis in Excel
This project is carried out to analyze the treatment and recovery statistics of patients in a hospital. The KPIs were analyzed across departments, Physicians, Age group, Length of Stay(LOS), and in terms of cost 
## The objective is to:
- Identify drivers of recovery outcomes
- Compare physician and departmental performance
- Analyze cost vs outcome relationships
- Support hospital-level operational decision-making
- This project simulates a health system performance analytics tool suitable for quality improvement and value-based care models

# Analytical Insights
## Department-Level Performance
- Pediatrics and Oncology show higher average recovery scores
- Standard deviation varies, suggesting inconsistent recovery within some departments
- Neurology shows a slightly lower recovery average
- Interpretation: Some departments may have variability in case complexity or treatment protocols.

## Doctor Performance
## Top performers:

- Dr. M. Patel
- Dr. L. Khan
- Lower range:
- Dr. T. Mehta
- Dr. R. Singh


## Treatment Type vs LOS
## Treatment	Avg LOS
- Surgery	15.2
- Medication	15.4
- Observation	16.5
- Therapy	17.0

Observation: Therapy and Observation have longer LOS. Therapy may involve prolonged rehabilitation. Observation may reflect chronic or complex cases.

## Treatment Type vs Recovery Score
Surgery and Therapy appear slightly stronger in recovery scores than Medication. More intensive interventions may yield better recovery outcomes — but cost efficiency must be evaluated.

## Cost Distribution

High Cost Patients: 53%

Low Cost Patients: 47%

This suggests a slight skew toward high-cost treatment utilization. Possible opportunity for cost optimization.

## Age Group Recovery

- Elderly and Senior groups show lower relative recovery.

- Young Adult and Middle-Aged groups perform better.
